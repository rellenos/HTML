Pocketful of honey and I'm ready to go
No, I ain't got no money, but I'm letting you know
That I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate, mm
Body make you silly, make you do what I want
Oh baby, I can make it pretty, I can string you along
But I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate, mm

No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losin' my m-m-m-mind, m-m-m-mind
M-m-m-mind, m-m-m-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

Put you in my hall of fame, middle of the wall
Yeah, you're my one, my favorite, my ride or die, oh
Yeah, I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in 'til I hallucinate, mm

No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losin' my m-m-m-mind, m-m-m-mind
M-m-m-mind, m-m-m-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

Wanna be right where you are
Let's go dancin' in the dark
Don't wait, you can push to start
Lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit
Make me lose my mind

I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losin' my m-m-m-mind, m-m-m-mind
M-m-m-mind, m-m-m-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my
